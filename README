1) Introduction
IRCLib is a Python IRC library for the 21st century and first decade. It is
designed with the needs of modern IRC in mind and also designed for maximum
flexibility whilst supporting major extensions built-in and many features that
users might consider desirable, such as user tracking.

This bot has been designed largely with IRCv3.1 in mind (http://ircv3.org).
No features of IRCv3.2 are not yet implemented but probably will be at some
indeterminate point.

2) Design
IRCLib is unfortunately designed with blocking I/O in mind, as that is the
simplest paradigm to program for (and most common), and things like gevent
exist. The Python threading.Timer module is used but can be easily hotswapped
for another form of asynchronous timers. There exists some limited support for
changing the bot to use non-blocking sockets, not discussed here. More support
for this is planned in the future.

The library is at some point going to also speak TS6, hence common/ and client/.

3) Bugs
Probably many! Tell me about them

4) Support
