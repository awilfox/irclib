1) Introduction
IRCLib is a Python IRC library for the 21st century and first decade. It is
designed with the needs of modern IRC in mind and also designed for maximum
flexibility whilst supporting major extensions built-in and many features that
users might consider desirable, such as user tracking.

This bot has been designed largely with IRCv3.1 in mind (http://ircv3.org).
No features of IRCv3.2 are mostly not yet implemented yet (some limited parsing
ability exists for message tags) but probably will be at some indeterminate
point.

2) Design
IRCLib is primarily designed with blocking I/O in mind, as that is the simplest
paradigm to program for (and most common), and things like gevent exist. It
should not be too difficult to force the bot to use a non-blocking mode of
operation with custom send/recv methods.

The Python threading.Timer module is used but can be easily swapped for any
other form of asynchronous timers.

The library is at some point going to also speak TS6, hence common/ and client/.
It is provided a server/ will eventually exist.

3) Bugs
Probably many! Tell me about them

4) Support
Try irc.interlinked.me #irclib. :)
